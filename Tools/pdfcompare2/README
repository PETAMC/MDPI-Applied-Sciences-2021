BUILDING
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
The following packages need to be installed to be able to build pdfcompare and pdfplot.

  • cairo
  • cairomm
  • freetype2
  • fontconfig
  • libconfig
  • clang++ (that supports C++17)
  • Adobe Source Sans Pro font

When all dependencies are installed, simply execute the build.sh script:

  ./build.sh


INSTALLATION
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
Execute the install.sh script with root privileges:

  sudo ./install.sh

Make sure that the path /usr/local/bin is inside the $PATH variable of your user.
You can check this by execution the following line:

  echo $PATH

If there is no "/usr/local/bin" in the :-separated PATH list,
add the path by adding the following line at the end of your shells configuration file.
For bash (see "echo $SHELL") it in "~/.bashrc".

  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin


USAGE
▔▔▔▔▔
You an generate plots by calling pdfplot with two arguments:

  • The configuration file describing the plot
  • The output file (pdf file) the plot will be stored in

There is one example configuration in the source directory: plot.cfg.
To build the example plot, run

  pdfplot ./testplot.cfg ./testplot.pdf

To transcode the pdf to an svg Inkscape can be used as follows:

  inkscape -o testplot.svg testplot.pdf

For using pdfcompare, just give the paths to the two histograms to compare.
No further configuration necessary.

  pdfcompare ../measurements/example.txt ../simulation/example.txt


CONFIGURATION
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
The configuration file for pdfplot is using the libconfig parser.
A detailed description of the syntax can be found under the following link:
    
    https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html#Configuration-Files

pdfcompare2 uses a list of histogram-description and some scalar values to describe some plot settings.
The data entry in the histograms description are mandatory, all other settings are optional.

The histograms list is build like in the following example:


  histograms = 
  (
      {
          data = "data/sampels 1.txt"
          label = "Measured";
          color = "#20A040";
      },
      {
          data = "data/samples 2.txt
          label = "Simulated";
          color = "#2040E0";
      }
  );


The number of histograms in the histograms-list is not limited.
Each histogram entry (within {}) must contain the following settings:

  • data:  A string containing the path to the samples to use for the histogram (list of integers).
  • label: A label to identify the data in the plot. This label is used for the legend of the plot.
           Default: "Data"
  • color: A color that is used to unify the data. This color will be used for the histogram (with alpha=50%)
           and for markers that highlight the average and maximum value.
           The color used the HTML hex-notation for colors (#RRGGBB).
           Default: "#808080"

Beside the histograms list there are the following settings as shown in the following example:

  alignbins   = true;
  drawmax     = true;
  drawavg     = true;
  xaxislabel  = "Iteration Duration [Cycles]";
  yaxislabel  = "Probability";
  pagewidth   = 13.5;
  pageheight  = 8.0;
  legendpos   = "left";

They have the following purpose:

  • alignbins:  A boolean value to enforce to use the same bin configuration for all histograms.
                This is one of the key features compared to the old pdfcompare.py tool.
                Default: false
  • drawmax:    When true, the vertical line highlighting the highest value in the samples will be added to the plot.
                Default: false
  • drawavg:    When true, the vertical dashed line highlighting the average value will be added to the plot.
                Default: false
  • xaxislabel: Label for the X-axis;
                Default: "Values"
  • yaxislabel: Label for the Y-axis;
                Default: "Probability"
  • pagewidth:  Define the width of the created pdf file in cm.
                Default: 13.5 (recommended for double column documents)
  • pageheight: Define the height of the created pdf file in cm.
                Default: 8.0
  • legendpos:  Position of the legend. Valid parameters are "left", "center", "right"
                Default: "left"
