The sub-directory tell to which memory the actors were mapped:
    - "bram": Private BRAM memory
    - "ddr":  Shared DDR memory without cache
    - "ddr+cache":  Shared DDR memory with cache

The file names follow the following naming scheme:

ActorName[-TileType].txt

Actor Name will be the name of the C-Function as also listed in the system.ini->[system]->actors list.

Tile Type will be 
    nothing for a microblaze without special features
    "-ef" for extended FPU
    "-ea" for extended ALU (HW Mult./Div.)

Example:

    InverseQuantization_Cr-ea.txt
    IDCT_Y-ef.txt
    GetEncodedImageBlock.txt
    
In the directory with the timing values, there is also a .jpg and .c file of the input image used for the characterization.
